# What is Proviral Pipeline?

<!-- TODO: better presentation form. More detail. -->

- Collection of programs that output images and CSV files.
- Is a pipeline. <!-- What this means is that it's a series of steps basically. -->
- Created by Don, Charlotte, and me <!-- I want to highlight the programmers' efforts. -->

# Initiation

<!-- TODO: better presentation form. More detail. -->

- Sample collection.

- Loading into MiSeq.

- Pickup by MiCall.

- MiCall initial processing.

Produces files such as <br> `conseq.csv` and `contigs.csv`.

- MiCall starts proviral pipeline.

# Pipeline structure

<!-- TODO: better presentation form. -->

- Proviral pipeline loads data.

From files generated by MiCall, specifically
<br> `conseq.csv`, `contigs.csv`, and `cascade.csv`.

- Proviral pipeline runs QC (quality checks).

- Proviral pipeline trims primers off.

- Samples that pass all checks proceed to HIVIntact.
<br><sup>HIVSeqInR is also still supported.</sup>

- Landscape data is generated.

- Final report is generated.

# Primer trimming

<v-drag pos="left">

The pipeline proceeds to find primers in the remaining sequences.
There are two primers: one at 5â€™ (forward) and one at 3â€™ (reverse) end.

<AccordionPrimers />

</v-drag>
<v-drag pos="bottom">

Once primers are found, they are cut off.

</v-drag>

<!--
After the initial filtering step, the pipeline proceeds to find primers in the filtered sequences. This step involves checking both ends of the sequence for the presence of forward and reverse primers.

# HIVIntact

- Originally HIVIntact, now evolved into CFEIntact.
- Performs automated checks for HIV-1 genome integrity.
- Identifies various genetic anomalies:
  - Large deletions
  - Hypermutations
  - Scrambles
  - ...
- Generates reports for regions, defects, <br> and various holistic properties.
- Details at https://cfe-lab.github.io/CFEIntact

<v-drag pos="cfeintactwebsite">
<iframe src="https://cfe-lab.github.io/CFEIntact/" style="transform: scale(0.8); margins: 1px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: 2px solid green; overflow: auto;"></iframe>

<!-- <img v-drag="'cfeintact'" style='border: 2px solid green;' src="./assets/cfeintactdocs.png" > -->

<!--
1. **Introduction**:
   CFEIntact is an essential part of the proviral pipeline. It started as a fork of HIVIntact and has evolved significantly since, to the point where the original publication was no longer correct for our version of HIVIntact.
2. **Key Functionality**:
   What CFEIntact does is provide an automated check for the integrity of HIV-1 genomes.
3. **Main Anomalies Detected**:
   We look for defects that can severely impact genome functionality. Hypermutations, are one example. But there are many possible kinds of them, and each defect type requires a custom algorithm to detect. So I can talk a lot about CFEIntact, but it's best to just check out the documentation, it's quite detailed.
4. **Output Files**:
   For every sample, CFEIntact generates detailed reports in CSV formatâ€”capturing defects, regions, and other relevant data.
5. **Limitations**:
   TODO: mention that in such matter as defect detection there can not be an synthetic algorith that is always correct. Furthermore, researchers are justified to override CFEIntact's decisions based on their domain expertise.

# Back to Proviral Pipeline

<!-- TODO: better presentation form. More detail. -->

- Analyzes CFEIntact's outputs.
- Decides what single error to report.
- Slices the input sequence into its parts.
- Generates `landscapes.csv`

# Region extraction in Proviral Pipeline

- Aligns sequences to the **HXB2 reference genome**.
- Extracts key **HIV regions**: *gag*, *pol*, *env*, *psi_sl1*, *gp120*, *ltr3*, etc.
- Handles **inversions** and **defective regions**.
- Outputs raw sequences to `table_precursor.csv`.

<img v-drag="[613,184,366,366]" src="./assets/regions.webp" />

<!--

Now few words about how the pipeline extracts genomic regions from the sequences.

- The first step is **aligning the input sequences** to the well-known **HXB2 reference genome**. For this, the pipeline uses blast and minimap2.
 
- Once aligned, the pipeline extracts key **HIV regions** like *gag*, *pol*, and *env*. But also some smaller, non-coding regions such as *psi_sl1,2,3* and *ltr3*.
 
- During this process, the pipeline is also looking for **inversions** and **defective regions**. If any region is inverted or missing key parts, it gets logged to standard error.
 
- All this information is then included into the final output file called `table_precursor.csv`.

# Pipeline's final verdict

<div></div>

- Proviral pipeline receives a _list of defects_ from **CFEIntact**.

- It tries to determine the most severe defect, <br>which becomes the pipeline's verdict.

- This procedure is described by the decision tree ðŸ‘‰

We use development version of BBLabs to draw landscape plots.
Eventually this version will be released, and everybody will be able to make them marvelous drawings!

Before the plots are generated, a translation step converts the defect types into categories that BBLabTools can represent graphically. Currently, BBLabTools is in a development phase, but it will be officially released in the upcoming version of our software. 

This plotter supports both CFEIntact and HIVSeqInR, but the translation is not ideal. For instance it translates <b>MutatedStopCodon</b> into <b>PrematureStop</b>.

# Future plans

<!-- TODO: better presentation form. More detail. -->

- BBLabTools release.
- Better support for subtypes in CFEIntact.
- More regions recognition in CFEIntact.
- Better output description in CFEIntact.

<img v-drag="[452,85,425,425]" src="./assets/future.webp">

<!--
TODO: improve these notes.

- BBLabTools will be released soon, with the landscape plots support.

- CFEIntact is currently not doing well with subtypes other than B, we want to fix that.

- It would be nice to output more regions information in CFEIntact, such as the various PSI locations.

- We want to give CFEIntact a notion of "confidence" and "severity", with which every defect can be labelled. 
  This can help researchers decide if they need to take a closer look.
  A natural example is the hypermutation check, which outputs probability that a given sequence was hypermutated.
  That is our confidence.
